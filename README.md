# âš¡ Zap Browser  
### _"The Browser Where the Node Is You."_

## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the Future of Decentralization

**Zap** isn't just another browser â€” itâ€™s a radical rethinking of what a web browser can be when it runs on a peer-to-peer foundation. Built entirely around **BTFS (BitTorrent File System)**, Zap injects decentralized networking into the browser itself, making every user a fully functional node in the network â€” not just a visitor.

This is not a plugin. This is not an extension.  
**This is the decentralized web, baked into the runtime.**

## ðŸš€ Built with One Mission:  
> To bring **true decentralization** to the web â€” not just in storage, but in communication, identity, and logic.

Where traditional browsers serve as windows into centralized services and IPFS gateways, **Zap** turns every tab into a **sovereign BTFS node**. This enables a new class of applications where the peer **is** the user, and the **node is the identity**.

## ðŸ’¡ Reimagining the dApp Stack

With Zap, dApps no longer need to rely on:

- External wallets to authenticate
- Centralized APIs for messaging
- Indexers or gateways to find content

Instead, BTFS and its native pub-sub protocols become first-class primitives in your frontend code:

```js
// Create a gossip chat room
window.btfs.createGossipSub("open-mic")

// Send a message to peers
window.btfs.publish("open-mic", "Hello from my node!")

// Ping another peer directly
window.btfs.pingPeer("QmPeerID123")

// Fetch a file natively
window.btfs.fetchFile("btfs://Qm...hash")

```
## The possibilities are endless.
